AI-Enabled CRO Workflow (Conceptual)

This repository provides a high-level, conceptual workflow showing how a contract research organization (CRO), such as Pentara, can combine human expertise, structured processes, and AI-enabled tools to support client-facing analytics and programming work.

The focus is on process design, not a production implementation. It highlights quality control, reuse of standards, and human oversight in regulated, data-intensive environments.
