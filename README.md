## 🧩 General Outline

1️⃣ **Client selection & meeting capture**  
You begin by selecting the client in the interface and recording your meeting as usual. Once the audio or video file is saved, the AI automatically picks it up, transcribes the content, and stores the transcript in the project’s folder.

2️⃣ **Research question drafting & review**  
Using the client’s data dictionary and meeting transcript, the system drafts candidate research questions. You are guided through reviewing, editing, and approving each question to ensure alignment with the client’s objectives.

3️⃣ **Spec sheet & code template generation**  
After questions are finalized, the tool generates corresponding spec sheets and code templates. Each output is reviewed and refined by the user before being approved.

4️⃣ **Storage & tracking**  
Approved spec sheets and code templates are saved to their respective databases, and the master tracking spreadsheet is updated so all tasks remain visible, organized, and traceable.

## 🎯 Purpose

• 🧾 Creates spec sheets and code templates for each client task or request  
• 👩‍🔬 Enables directors and senior statisticians to review work early, before production or validation  
• 🤖 AI **only drafts and verifies** documents based on defined guidelines — it never executes code  
• 🧑‍💻 Code templates act as structured guides, keeping production and validation programs clean and consistent  
• 📊 All outputs feed into a master spreadsheet that can be updated over time without breaking the workflow
